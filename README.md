Prime examples of how not to code! Including
* Terrible variable naming conventions
* Code smells
* What are helper functions?!
* There's a db but let us write to the disk anyways
* Local vars? EVERYTHING GLOBAL!
* Giant if statements.
* Race conditions? Nah they'll never come up
* Let's hope this array is always the same size!
* Maybe I can pause the script by taking up CPU power...
* and many more!
